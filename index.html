    <h3>Freshmen Year</h3>
        Coming into this school as a freshman can be very difficult for many reasons.
        Highschool is a very different place compared to Junior Highschool and elementary school.
        This makes adjusting to the new environment hard for many. However, one of the biggest pieces of advice
        that I can give is to be yourself. You will always find people that are just like you or have the same
        interest as you. 
        
        You must also put yourself out there, however. You can not be shy when it comes to introducing yourself 
        to people. You should thus join any clubs that interest you or even join a sports team. I know that for myself,
        if it was not for my teammates on the baseball team, I would not have the great friends that I have now.
        
        When it comes to your classes, you should start highschool on a very good note. This is just the start of four years of hard work.
        Everything that you do from now to the end will always be kept on record so make sure that you make the choices
        that will benefit you and your future the most. I am not saying that you have to be a scholar and be a 
        straight A student, but instead do your work to the best abilities. Do all the hard work now when you are young so that 
        your future can be easy.

            <h4>Junior Year</h4>
        Junior year can be considered one of the hardest years in Higschool. This is when you are already adjusted 
        to the highschool environment, and the work begins to get much harder. You must stay focused especially for
        this year. Try your best to maintain good grades in every class because this is the year that your grades go
        to the colleges that you apply to. On that note, make sure that you make it a huge priority to start researching
        colleges that you would possibly want to apply to during senior year.
