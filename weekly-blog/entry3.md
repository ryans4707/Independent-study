# Entry 3: SASS Functions and Operations

There are multiple things that can be done with SASS functions. One thing that 
comes already built into SASS are functions that make it very easy to work with
color.<br>
For Example:<br>
There is a function called `fade-out` which is used to make color more 
transparent by choosing a number between 0 and 1 and then the color will fade
depending on how high the number is.
<br>
<br>
On the other hand the `fade-in` method is used to increase a colors 
opacity (the condition of lacking transparency).
<br>
<br>
 In addition to those functions, SASS allows us to perform mathematical functions.
 This is done by using the red, green and blue color components and is the math is 
 done on every two numbers of the colors. For Example:<br>
 
 `$color: #040601 + #050103`<br>
 `04 + 05 = 09`<br>
 `06 + 01 = 07`<br>
 `01 + 03 = 04`<br>
 
 all of this compiles to `color :#090704`<br>
 All the arethmic operations are: <br>
 
addition +<br>
subtraction -<br>
multiplication *<br>
division /<br>
modulo %.<br>
All of these operations are uses regularly. For example, 10px * 10px equals
100px. The modulo is used to get the remainder of any division like with
10%3 the output would be 1.<br>
<br>
## Takeaways

There are many simple things that could be learned so do not always think so 
hard when learning something and do not over complicate things.
