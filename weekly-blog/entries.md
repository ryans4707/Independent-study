# Entry 1: Intro / Plan

## What EXACTLY is SASS? 
SASS(Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet) is the extention language to
CSS and is basically the more powerful version of CSS. In SASS there is 
different concepts that need to be learned or known:
<br>
<br>
Nesting
 <ul> 
 <li> Placing child selectors and properties in a parent selector. For example:<br>
 .container {
 <br>
  text-align: center;
  <br>
  font-family: 'Pacifico', cursive;
  <br>
  .icon {<br>
  display: inline-block;<br>
  margin: 2%;<br>
  border: $standard-border;<br>
  font-size: 32px;<br>
    width: $icon-square-length;<br>
height: $icon-square-length;<br>
	}<br>
}
<br>

Variables

<li>Sass allows there to be variables that can be used if you know that you will have the same kind of code in a different block.
This saves you from having to keep on typing the same thing over again and can even make everything more organized.

Data Types

<li> Numbers, Strings, Booleans (AND, OR, NOT or AND NOT), Null, Lists, and Maps.

## Takeaways

<li>Knowing some background knowledge on certain things can benefit you. For example, knowing alot about CSS and HTML will definitely help
me in learning this new topic.
<li> Actually being interactive helps learn much more easily. For example, I have been using CodeAcademy and following every instruction.
<li> Read everything that can possibly help any missed little detail can be extremely important to what you are trying to learn
