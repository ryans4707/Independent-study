# Entry 6:  Product Idea
 
After completing Code Academy and trying out different things based on some of the things that 
I have learned, I have began to think about ideas for a project to make from SASS. 

My first thought was that I knew that instead of just making a website with just information, 
I want to make something that could be possibly be helpful to me or other people. 

I then began to think about things that I do throughout my life that can be improved.
So then I thought about school and studying, since it something that I have been going through
throughout my whole life. So what I thought about was what if I tried to make a kind of flash card
maker where a person can choose the amount of flashcards that they would need and then they can write 
any information that is useful for them on each side. If they are trying to study vocabulary, maybe they can put 
the word on one side and the definition on the other and instead of them just thinking about 
what the answer is in their head and then flipping the car over to see what the correct definition is, they can 
be able to type what they are thinking into a box. Then based on what they type there can be something that matches
words that they typed to what the real definition is and if the majority is correct, then they would get that card correct.
There can also be a tracker for what words they got wrong and what words they got right. In addition, to this, I thought about 
having some kind of hint where there can be a hidden picture on the side of the index card and if the person is stuck but just needs
a little hint to help them, then the picture or word can help them for a quick second and then be hidden again.

This would of course be styled using SASS and would use many things that I have learned so far in order to create 
a very helpful website.

# Takeaways

One takeaway I would have is that since SASS is a topic where there are so many possibilities, try to think outside the
box when it comes to thinking about ideas for your project.

Coming up with something that has not been done or seen before is much more interesting than seeing something that is
very common and simple.
