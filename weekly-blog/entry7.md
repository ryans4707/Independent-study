# Entry 6:  Start of My Product

After seeing the feedback that Mr.Mueller provided me for my last entry, I decided 
that I would just create a website that would inform incomming freshmen or kids 
that are still trying to get used to the highschool environment, on how to adapt to highschool.
This can be kind of called a highschool survival guide. This would most likely include 
topics like the things that they should be doing and the things that they should not be doing.
This would also include a section that would explain how to handle situations that someone might
go through. In addition to this, including the importance of things like applying to colleges, the Quality of Life paper
and not slacking off any year of highschool, even senior year. I hope to really influence many students that see this. 

Throughout this website I would include many things when it comes to the design of the website. 
For example, I would most likely include things like animation and other creative things that 
I learned in the past and now throughout this independent study.

 

# Takeaways

Wanting to create something that would help kids in highschool I know that it is important
to include every possible things and not to leave out anythings that can possibly be 
related.
